## Introduction

In this assessment, you will create a basic smart contract for a token called "Metacrafter". The token will have a name, abbreviation, and total supply. You will implement minting and burning functionalities to manage the token supply.


1. Public variables to store:
   - Token Name
   - Token Abbreviation
   - Total Supply

2. A mapping to associate addresses with their token balances.

3. A `mint` function to create new tokens and assign them to a specific address.

4. A `burn` function to destroy tokens from a specific address, ensuring the address has enough tokens to burn.
